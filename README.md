# Backend Software Engineer (Python · FastAPI · AWS)

Engineering Physicist and freelance **backend & systems engineer**.  
I design and build **robust backend services and data workflows** in Python, with a strong focus on **REST APIs, PostgreSQL and AWS (EC2/RDS/S3)**. In several projects I have connected these backends with **mobile apps for field operations (offline→online)** and, when needed, with **embedded devices (STM32/ESP32)**.

Primary focus on **backend reliability, data integrity and traceability**.  
Secondary expertise in **embedded/edge systems** when hardware integration is required.

## Core Expertise

- **Backend & APIs (Primary)**  
  Python (FastAPI/Flask), REST API design, JWT/OAuth2, RBAC, OpenAPI/Swagger, async SQLAlchemy, pagination, validation, error handling.

- **Cloud & DevOps (Primary)**  
  AWS (EC2, RDS PostgreSQL, S3, SES), Docker, Git, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Terraform, environment configuration, logging and basic monitoring.

- **Data & Observability (Primary)**  
  PostgreSQL, schema design, Alembic migrations, query optimization basics, structured logs, metrics, audit trails.

- **Embedded & Edge Systems (Secondary)**  
  STM32, ESP32, C/C++, UART/SPI/I2C, timers/PWM (steppers/servos), basic OTA and watchdog patterns, edge–cloud protocols.

- **Frontend & Mobile (Complementary)**  
  Angular (TypeScript) and Flutter (Dart) for mobile/web clients consuming REST APIs, with offline storage and sync flows.

## Featured Project — Autonomous Chessboard

**ChessProject** — STM32-based robotic chessboard with real-time AI integration  

Electromechanical system that executes chess games on a physical board. A CNC-style XY gantry driven by steppers and a servo-lift magnet picks and places pieces. The STM32 firmware handles motion control and safety, while a Python backend orchestrates game logic and telemetry.

**Tech stack**

- Firmware: STM32/HAL (C), timers/PWM, endstops, UART protocol  
- Backend: Flask (Python), Stockfish, python-chess, Docker  
- Tooling: Eagle PCB, Linux, basic logging/telemetry

**Highlights**

- Translation of AI/online moves into physical motion on the board  
- Safe homing, limit handling and error recovery  
- Documented bring-up guide and reproducible hardware diagrams

**Next steps**

- Add velocity/acceleration profiles and jitter fine-tuning  
- Standardize telemetry with ROS2 (TF2, colcon)  
- Mechanical refinements (stiffness, cabling, enclosure)
